# start scene with Prince
@ {
    It's the evening of the Coronation Ball, and you're alone with Prince $P at the entrance of the hedge maze.
}
@P:h {
    $MC $LN, you're incredible in every sense of the word.
}
@P:n {
    And I don't want to spend another minute without you knowing exactly how I feel.
}
@P:n {
    I've never said this to anyone before, but I know it's more true than my own name. Which is all to
    say...
}
@P:h {
    $MC... I love you.
}
@MC:n {
    $P...
    <[1.1*These choices are in the actual trr finale!] I love you too.>
    <[1.2*These choices are in the actual trr finale!] I'm not sure about this.>
    <[1.3] I'm so sorry... I'm falling for someone else.>

        I'm falling for...

            Prince $P tries to muster a smile, but it comes out looking pained.

            That's... okay. You're the best thing to ever step into this palace, and anyone would be lucky to have you.

        @P:n {
            So... I'm glad... that it's Drake.

             I'm really sorry for hurting you.

            Prince $P's brows furrow slightly, and his eyes linger on you for a long moment.

            $MC, I want you to know... I still meant everything I said.

            A heavy silence fills the space between the two of you. You look down at your hands.
        }
        @ {
            Finally, Prince $P speaks.
        }
        @P:s {
             If it's okay with you, I think I need a minute alone.

            Prince $P bows, then hurries away.
